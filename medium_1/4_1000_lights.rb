# You have a bank of switches before you, numbered from 1 to n. Each switch is connected
# to exactly one light that is initially off. You walk down the row of switches
# and toggle every one of them. You go back to the beginning, and on this second
# pass, you toggle switches 2, 4, 6, and so on. On the third pass, you go back again
# to the beginning and toggle switches 3, 6, 9, and so on. You repeat this process
# and keep going until you have been through n repetitions.
#
# Write a method that takes one argument, the total number of switches, and returns
# an Array that identifies which lights are on after n repetitions.
#
# Example with n = 5 lights:
#
# round 1: every light is turned on
# round 2: lights 2 and 4 are now off; 1, 3, 5 are on
# round 3: lights 2, 3, and 4 are now off; 1 and 5 are on
# round 4: lights 2 and 3 are now off; 1, 4, and 5 are on
# round 5: lights 2, 3, and 5 are now off; 1 and 4 are on
# The result is that 2 lights are left on, lights 1 and 4. The return value is [1, 4].
#
# With 10 lights, 3 lights are left on: lights 1, 4, and 9. The return value is [1, 4, 9].

# initialize the light hash
def initialize_lights(number_of_lights)
  lights = Hash.new
  1.upto(number_of_lights) { |number| lights[number] = "off" }
  lights
end

# return list of number of lights that are on
def on_lights(lights)
  lights.select { |_position, state| state == "on" }.keys
end

# toggle every nth light in lights hash
def toggle_every_nth_light(lights, nth)
  lights.each do |position, state|
    if position % nth == 0
      lights[position] = (state == "off") ? "on" : "off"
    end
  end
end

# run entire program for number of lights
def toggle_lights(number_of_lights)
  lights = initialize_lights(number_of_lights)
  1.upto(lights.size) do |iteration_number|
    toggle_every_nth_light(lights, iteration_number)
